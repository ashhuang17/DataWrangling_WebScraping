# DataWrangling_WebScraping

The goal here is to examine the data we grab from webscraping, see the comparison between the two and find out which website has more reliable information when it comes to movie scores. I will be working on the movies from 2019, and since IMDB already has the movie scores from metacritic, we will use IMDB for web scraping and exploration.
